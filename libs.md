| Name | Explainable model | Description |
|:--:|:--:|--|
| [rfpimp](https://github.com/parrt/random-forest-importances) | sklearn | include permutation and drop-column importance measures |

| [cxplain](https://github.com/d909b/cxplain) | black box | a CXPlain model consists of four main components: <ul><li>The model to be explained which can be any type of machine-learning model, including black-box models, such as neural networks and ensemble models</li><li>The model builder that defines the structure of the explanation model to be used to explain the explained model</li><li>The masking operation that defines how CXPlain will internally simulate the removal of input features from the set of available features</li><li>The loss function that defines how the change in prediction accuracy incurred by removing an input feature will be measured by CXPlain</li></ul>
